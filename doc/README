OIDUA
~~~~~
OIDUA is an Audiolist[1] clone.  It makes a catalog from a directory tree of
audio files.

OIDUA does not look much like its predecessor as it is a command line tool while Audiolist only sports a graphical user interface. Apart from that OIDUA's functionality is a complete superset of Audiolist's.

There is a Windows GUI available called GUIDUA, courtesy of Brandon West. See project website for link.
Please feel free to contact us if you would like to make a graphical frontend
for any platform. We will be happy to help you out.


Purpose
~~~~~~~
There are a few reasons why we started this project.
  * There were no programs like Audiolist outside the Windows
    platform
  * Audiolist is dead. There has been no sign of the guy who made it for a very
    long time
  * I guess we wanted a project like this anyway
