"""UTF-8 drop-in replacements for various os.path functions.

Dnuos has always assumed UTF-8 as the file system encoding, but this isn't
always the case, especially on Windows. These functions take UTF-8 strings,
decode them to unicode objects, and pass them to the underlying os.path
functions. Any functions that return paths with unicode objects are
encoded back into UTF-8 strings.

This has the effect that UTF-8 can be used even if the file system uses
a different encoding, due to decoding to unicode beforehand.
